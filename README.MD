# Example Project
This is an example project, to attempt to debug an issue that I'm having in my FantasyFootball app

# Issue Description
I'm making a sortable list, so that the users can manage the order of the players on their bench.

Having difficulty keeping the react-dom up to date, with what the user has picked.
- The data in the console shows correctly, just as intended.
- The visual order on the webpage, is wrong.

The visual will be correct, if the user refreshes the page, which is not intended.
